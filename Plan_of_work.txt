Plan of work:

-1) Create basic CSS styles, define color paletes, layouts

-2) Create basic UI components: buttons, modals, links

-3) Add pagination:
    Home page(will display all todo records with applied sorting and filters)
    Todo record creation page. Will create new todo record and save it to the local storage (in future will use database on backend to store records)
    Todo record alter page. Will alter todo record: its title, description, timeout date, attached image

-4) Create logic. Will use Redux-toolkit to manage Todo records. 
    Main functions are:
    Create todo record, each todo record belongs to a certain class, so records could be easily filtered by classes
    Each record also contain creatinon timestamp and timeout timestamp, which can also be used for filtering and sorting records
    Title and content of each record can also be used for filtering and sorting operations.
    To acomplish this, I will be using Redux selectors.

5) Make todo cards smaller. Make them appear as list, not grid

6) Make todo records titles appears in the calendar as small notes

7) Add division by hours
